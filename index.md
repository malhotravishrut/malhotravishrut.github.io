      Research interests: International Trade, Firm Dynamics and Upgrading, Structural Transformation

    <p>
      I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Ashoka University, currently on the job market.
      My research explores the intersection of international trade and firm dynamics, with an emphasis on the
      mechanisms behind firm upgrading. My Job Market Paper examines how Indian manufacturers respond to
      Chinese competition. I document a “quality-deepening” effect, wherein firms invest in advanced
      technology and higher-quality raw materials to enhance the quality of their products. These findings
      underscore how firms in developing economies can harness competitive pressures to upgrade and foster
      growth. Methodologically, I utilize both theoretical modelling and empirical analysis to understand
      firm growth. I am particularly interested in the role of policy in helping firms in the Global South
      transition from cost-competitive producers to global innovation leaders.
